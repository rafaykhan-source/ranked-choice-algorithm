"""This module contains the Person Abstract Datatype (ADT).

Provided a Person's information from a spreadsheet, this class
functions primarily as a wrapper of one's information, their
ranked choices and supports operations.

Typical usage example:

person = Person(name="John Doe", 
                id="jd0000", 
                choices=["choice1", "choice2", "choice3"])
